# Ontology library for IoT-related Product Data

The Java code in this repository was **generated** with [OLGA](https://ecostruxure.github.io/OLGA/), the 
Ontology Library Generator.

This automatically generated library is a companion to the project https://github.com/edufuga/LinkedDataScala/.
More specifically, the **ontology file** (of which this library is a _representation_) can be found
[here](https://github.com/edufuga/LinkedDataScala/blob/main/linked_data_ontology_rdf.owl).

A description of the ontology can be found [here](https://github.com/edufuga/LinkedDataScala/blob/main/Ontology.md).

For more background information, please read the article 
[A Model Driven Approach Accelerating Ontology-based IoT Applications Development](
